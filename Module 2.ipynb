Because the original dataset is too large, we ramdomly sample 100,000 reviews as the source. The first step is tansfering all \"n't\" to \"not\". Punctuations are also deleted and capital letters are converted to lower-case letters. Then all words' frequency accroding to review stars. Below is some typical samples."
