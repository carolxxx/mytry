    "**Generating Sentimental Words and Symbols List:** Our method is using some meaningful words and punctuations to grade each review. We aim at generating a sentimental words list initially. Because the original dataset is too large, we ramdomly sample 100,000 reviews as the source. The first step is tansfering all \"n't\" to \"not\". Punctuations are also deleted and capital letters are converted to lower-case letters. Then calculate all words' frequency accroding to review stars. Below is some typical samples."

    "According to the plots above, we know that the key word usually have a clear tendency in distribution. Negative words appear in low rating reviews more, while positive words have a high frequency in 4 and 5 stars reviews. And words have a distribution, which has a shape similar to bell and the peak around 3 stars are defined as neutral words. What's more, the words having concave distributions usually express extreme emotions because they apear in 1 and 5 stars reviews more frequently. It's easy to find that these meaningful words have a common feature, their frequencies of each star vary a lot."
